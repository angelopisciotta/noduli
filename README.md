# AI METHOD FOR LUNG NODULES DETECTION IN CT SCANS

This program, developed on Google Colab using Python 3, implements a Transformer-based AI model, leveraging the DETR pre-trained model and ResNet-50.  This model was fine-tuned using a dataset of 1940 PNG images of CT scans of the thoracic area from 30 patients diagnosed with lung cancer. The dataset had a 1:1 ratio of positive scans to background images.

The code is available in the "Modello_noduli.ipynb" notebook, which contains code cells for annotation file creation, image pre-processing, model training, and result presentation.
